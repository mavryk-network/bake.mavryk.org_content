## What is Mavryk Baking?
Fundamentally speaking, "Baking" on Mavryk involves 2 things:

1. The creation of blocks every 10 seconds as well as the attestation of the soundness of blocks produced by other bakers. Bakers put their mav at stake in order to be able to bake blocks and attest other bakers' blocks. The mav put at stake by the bakers is used as deterrent against bakers acting maliciously. If a baker acts maliciously, they will lose their mav at stake. If a baker acts honestly, they will be rewarded with mav from the protocol. To act maliciously, a baker would have to create a block that is invalid or attest to a block that is invalid.

2. Participating in the Mavryk proposal governance process. A Mavryk proposal is able to change anything about the Mavryk protocol rules as well to fund any address with mav from the protocol.
